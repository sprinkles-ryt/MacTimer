# MacTimer
really shitty, but POC. wasn't too useful to me


a timer of 25 seconds will run, and then start to make a beeping noise until you reset it. You can reset it with arrow up key. Once you reset the timer will count down again.
With arrow down, you should be able to pause/unpause it.

enjoy :P
